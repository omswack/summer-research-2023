# Climate Dynamics @ USC 🌍
+ Over the summer of 2023, I interned as a research assistant under the Climate Dynamics Lab at USC. My primary task was to produce a model that analyzes the net warming trends at Earth's atmosphere (Troposphere) from the last few thousand years through the 22nd century. All of the data I used is from [CMIP6](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained/).

+ Notebooks shared include comments and explanations to serve as a step-by-step tutorial. Not all of the work / final results are shared as these contributions are apart of an ongoing research paper. To learn more about the results, please contact my email: swack@usc.edu.
